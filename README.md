# TwitterDelBot(TwitDel)
Delete all your tweets.
Just a fun project built in half an hour using the Python-Twitter, a wrapper around Twitter API.

## Prerequisites

 First Install [Python-Twitter](https://github.com/Ritvik1512/python-twitter)
 * [Register a Twitter-App](https://apps.twitter.com) and allow it to read and write your profile.

## Installation and Usage:

 1. `git clone https://github.com/Ritvik1512/twitdel`
 2. Edit the file `twitdel.py` to include the keys you obtained from Twitter's Apps page.
 3. `python2 twitdel.py`
 
 You might have to repeat step3 some times, because Twitter allows for only, 200 requests at one time. Crap! :(

 Enjoy!
